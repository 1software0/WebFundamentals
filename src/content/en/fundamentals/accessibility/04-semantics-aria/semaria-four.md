Let's pause here for one small but important point: Just as you would test regular HTML code by viewing it in a browser, you should test your accessibility-compliant code with a real-world screen reader.

Although ChromeVox Lite and VoiceOver are great ways to get a feel for the basic screen reader experience, we recommend NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access), a free, open-source screen reader that is very popular with Windows users.

WebAIM conducts an annual survey of screen reader users that includes popularity rankings for various screen readers, and NVDA consistently scores very high on the list. Here is [their 2015 survey](http://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey6/#used); the report also includes links to previous surveys.

You can find more information about NVDA and how to use it at the following links.
