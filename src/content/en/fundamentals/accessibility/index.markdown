# Introduction

This document set is a text-based version of part of the content covered in the Udacity course on Accessibility. Rather than a direct transcription of the video course, it is meant to be a more concise treatment of accessibility principles and practices, using the course's original content as a base.

In this course, you'll learn basic principles for accessible web development, and how to make your sites accessible not just for people with disabilities, but for everyone. 

The course consists of an introduction, five lessons, and a brief wrap-up. 

The **Introduction** provides an overview of accessibility and its challenges.

**Lesson 1** covers *focus* and how you can manage it in your application. 

**Lesson 2** introduces *semantics* as it applies to assistive technology.

**Lesson 3** covers semantics as it relates to *navigation* in screen readers.

**Lesson 4** introduces *ARIA* and how to express non-native semantics with it.

**Lesson 5** covers *styling* and its importance to accessibility.

The goal is to help you write more accessible sites without negatively impacting your development process, take advantage of existing technologies and techniques, and generally improve your interface design skills.
